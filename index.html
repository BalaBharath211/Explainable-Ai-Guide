    <!-- Chosen Palette: "Warm Neutrals" with Teal accents -->
    <!-- Application Structure Plan: The application is designed as a progressive, single-page learning journey. It starts with beginner concepts and builds complexity, guiding the user through distinct, scrollable sections. This vertical, narrative structure is more intuitive for a topic that requires foundational knowledge before tackling advanced concepts. A sticky navigation bar allows users to jump between logical learning modules (The Problem, The Tools, The Comparison, The Future, The Practice). This structure was chosen over a dashboard because the goal is education and storytelling, not data exploration. Key interactions include dynamic charts that visually demonstrate how LIME and SHAP work, reinforcing the theoretical concepts with immediate visual feedback. -->
    <!-- Visualization & Content Choices: 
        1. 'Black Box' Diagram: Info: The opaque nature of complex AI models. Goal: Inform. Viz: Simple HTML/CSS diagram. Interaction: None. Justification: A simple visual metaphor is most effective for this introductory concept.
        2. LIME Simulation: Info: LIME's local approximation method. Goal: Explain. Viz: Chart.js scatter plot with a non-linear boundary. Interaction: User clicks on a data point to see a simple linear model (a tangent line) drawn, approximating the local decision. Justification: This interaction directly mimics LIME's core function—making a complex model understandable at a specific point.
        3. SHAP Force Plot: Info: SHAP's feature contribution model. Goal: Explain & Compare. Viz: Chart.js horizontal bar chart. Interaction: User selects a prediction scenario from a dropdown, and the chart updates to show which features contributed positively or negatively. Justification: This visualizes the "push and pull" of features on the final prediction, which is the core insight SHAP provides.
        4. Comparison Table: Info: LIME vs. SHAP trade-offs. Goal: Compare. Viz: Styled HTML table. Interaction: Hover effects for readability. Justification: A table is the clearest way to present a direct, feature-by-feature comparison.
        5. Accordions: Info: Advanced topics and project ideas. Goal: Organize. Viz: HTML/JS accordions. Interaction: Click to expand. Justification: This keeps the advanced/practical sections clean and prevents overwhelming the user, allowing them to explore what interests them.

                Level 1: The 'Black Box' Conundrum
            </h2>
            <p class="mt-4">This first section introduces the core problem that XAI aims to solve. We explore why the most powerful AI models are often the most opaque, and why this lack of transparency is a major barrier to their adoption in critical, real-world applications where the 'why' is just as important as the 'what'.</p>

            <h3>What is the 'Black Box' Problem?</h3>
            <p>
                In AI, a "black box" refers to a model whose internal workings are not visible or understandable to humans. We can see the inputs (data we feed in) and the outputs (the model's prediction), but the process in between is a complex web of mathematical operations, often involving millions or billions of parameters. This is especially true for deep learning models like neural networks.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Analogy: The Magic Coffee Machine.</strong> Imagine a coffee machine. You put in beans and water (inputs) and get a perfect cup of coffee (output). But you have no idea *how* it does it. You can't see the grinder, the heater, or the filter. If it suddenly makes a bad cup, you have no way to diagnose or fix the problem. This is the essence of the black box problem in AI.

            <h3>Why is Explainability so Important?</h3>
            <p>
                Trust is the cornerstone of adoption for any technology. In high-stakes domains, a simple prediction is not enough. We need to trust that the prediction was made for the right reasons.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Healthcare:</strong> If an AI model predicts a patient has a high risk of cancer, a doctor needs to know *why*. Is it based on a specific anomaly in a scan, family history, or a spurious correlation in the data? The explanation is critical for diagnosis and building trust with both doctors and patients.</li>
                <li><strong>Finance:</strong> When a bank's AI denies a loan application, regulations (like the Equal Credit Opportunity Act) may require the bank to provide a reason. An explanation helps ensure the model isn't discriminating based on protected characteristics like race or gender, and provides transparency to the customer.</li>
            </ul>

                Level 2: Peeking Inside with LIME & SHAP
            </h2>
            <p class="mt-4">Now that we understand the problem, let's explore two of the most popular and powerful tools for solving it. LIME and SHAP are "model-agnostic" techniques, meaning they can be applied to any black box model. This section provides both a conceptual and an interactive understanding of how they work their magic.</p>

            <h3>LIME: Local Explanations</h3>
            <p>
                <strong>LIME</strong> stands for <strong>L</strong>ocal <strong>I</strong>nterpretable <strong>M</strong>odel-agnostic <strong>E</strong>xplanations. The key word here is "Local". LIME doesn't try to explain the entire complex model at once. Instead, it focuses on explaining a *single prediction*.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Analogy: The Bumpy Landscape.</strong> Imagine the AI model's decision-making process is a complex, bumpy landscape. Instead of trying to map the entire landscape, LIME picks one spot (a specific prediction) and approximates the ground around it with a simple, flat plane. This "plane" is an interpretable model (like a linear regression) that is only accurate in that small, local area, but is very easy to understand.
            </p>
            <div class="my-8 bg-gray-50 p-6 rounded-lg border">
                 <h4 class="text-xl font-semibold text-center mb-4">Interactive LIME Simulation</h4>
                 <p class="text-center text-sm mb-4">The blue curve represents a complex model's decision boundary. Click on a data point (a patient) to see how LIME creates a simple, local explanation (the red line) for that specific prediction.</p>

                <p id="limeExplanation" class="text-center mt-4 font-medium text-teal-700 h-6"></p>
            </div>
            
            <h3>SHAP: Fairly Distributing the Prediction</h3>
            <p>
                <strong>SHAP</strong> stands for <strong>SH</strong>apley <strong>A</strong>dditive ex<strong>P</strong>lanations. It's rooted in cooperative game theory and the concept of Shapley values, a method for fairly distributing a "payout" among players in a game.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Analogy: The Team Project.</strong> Imagine a team of students (features) completes a project and gets a score of 95% (the prediction). How do you fairly credit each student for their contribution to that final score? SHAP calculates this by considering every possible subgroup of students and seeing how the score changes when a particular student joins. By averaging these marginal contributions, it assigns a precise value (a SHAP value) to each student's impact. Features that pushed the score up get positive values; those that pulled it down get negative values.
            </p>

In contrast, the SHAP paper by Lundberg & Lee (2017) introduces a unified framework that guarantees properties like consistency, which LIME does not.</p>

                        <p>Humans reason using high-level concepts, not individual pixels or data points. Concept-based methods aim to explain a model's decision in terms of these concepts. For an image classifier identifying a zebra, instead of saying "these pixels were important," it might say "it focused on the concept of 'stripes'."

                        <p>Most XAI methods show correlation, not causation. A famous example is an AI that linked coughing to lung cancer. While correlated, coughing doesn't cause cancer. Causal XAI attempts to uncover the true causal relationships in the data, providing a much deeper and more robust form of explanation. This is a very active but challenging area of research.

                        <br><strong>Task:</strong> Train a classifier (like a Random Forest or Gradient Boosting model) to predict survival. Then, use the LIME library to pick a few specific passengers (e.g., a wealthy first-class woman, a poor third-class man) and generate local explanations to see which features (age, class, sex) were most influential in their predicted outcome.</p>

Apply both LIME and SHAP to explain why a particular review was classified as positive or negative.
